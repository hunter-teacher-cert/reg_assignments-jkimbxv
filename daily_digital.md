Description:
* Google engineers claim they were fired for trying to organize.
* Details are currently under wraps due to an NDA
* Working for big tech comes with a lot of perks especially status. However, many employees feel like they are under harsh surveillance and are expected to work inhumane hours. Google and other big techs are possibly trying to crack down on any discontent getting out to the public that may harm their "welcoming" vibes. Would you still like to work for these kinds of firms after a program in CS? Why? Why not?

* I wanted to get students thinking about this as they slowly enter the work force. Students should think about what they are and are not willing to give up in the context of their work life balance.
