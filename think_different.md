* Describe 3 different strategies for implementing differentiation in a CS class.
* Things to consider
  - What are you differentiating for (ability, interest, learning style preference...)?
  - Are students being grouped? If so, how?
  - What is the goal of differentiation for this specific strategy?
  - Anything else you deem important

Strategy 1: Walk, Run, Fly
- I scaffold by providing students the chance to excel.
- I give everyone the same project often heavily scaffolded to provide a route to achieve for beginner coders.
- I then give extra credit assignments of varying difficulties. Sometimes I will require the extra credit other times I will make it optional. All of it depends on how difficult the base project is.

Strategy 2: unplugged lessons
- unplugged lessons help students who have a hard time doing the abstraction of CS and help students of varying abilities show their understanding. 

Strategy 3: Heterogeneous grouping
- Students are working with students of varying abilities. Some students who are "medium level comfort" with coding may be paired in homogeneous groups but some comfortable students may be paired with beginner students so that co-teaching can take place.
