#Notes
what is equity?
who decides what questions for assessments
education is to teach skills
report performance on content
curve is detrimental agreed

point value system (grades) emphasized
behavior being graded.
skill based grading
grade is specific to a level of mastery
grade should be based on content mastery
feedback on behavior -- how to entice students though?
kendi- structures create beliefs
preparation/hw should have purpose and should pay off

late policy- time management scaffolding
inaccurate grades due to points taking off
1st time pass, think a bit more on what happened . (respectful communication)
this seems like a lot of time for teachers

unwritten rules of asking for an extention
be explicit with directions and things you're ok with
this isn't a fair comparison because the prof has TAs
and the grader will have a swamp of work

something we can do now--just try something
something long term- uniform grading across departments, school

I understand grades are communication but they're also used for college acceptance for k thru 12  how to balance

1. Do you agree with the general sentiment?
I agree that grading should be reformed. I'm glad to hear the discussion revolve around higher education as I feel many HS teachers take their cues from higher ed.

2. Do you have specific points of agreement/disagreement?
I disagree slightly regarding the late policy. I understand in the work force you have some degree of leniency. However, teachers are under scrutiny constantly and I feel this subjective form of bookkeeping could lead to a lot of conflict in the politics of the school.

3. I already do implement some of the suggestions specifically understanding students are given wiggle room with deadlines. I also give a lot of optional practice for students and find that students who do well in the course are due to doing that optional practice. I wish most to implement the skills based rubric but working in a district that does not shy away from conflict I feel the points keeps the students accountable. My biggest issue is that grades still do play a role in admissions so I feel I can't ever get rid of it completely. If I can't get rid of it completely then students will always focus on it.
