grading schema for csv_lab.py

A few years back when I first started teaching, I attended a conference where we learned about Mastery teaching. Students were expected to obtain a certain set of skills from each assignment and were "graded" on a linear scale where the left was marked "beginner" and the right was labeled "mastery". The teacher would mark where they felt the student was at the point of turning in the assignment and date that. The student could then turn it in again a couple times for a higher score. Overall, grades were not a part of their transcript but instead teachers wrote blurbs describing how the student grew and learned over time. I feel given that this assignment is a formative one where students are learning how to work with csv files in python, this type of schema would be appropriate. I'd look for the following skills.

* can they get headers of a csv
* can they get a subset of the list?
* can they take the csv file and convert it into a workable form in python
* how could we take this usable file and gather information from it? What are some summative data points you could generate?
