* Describe an instance when you were teaching somthing computer science related and it went poorly.
I tried to implement a self-check list to helps students keep more on task during the create task of the AP CSP exam. This was all in an attempt to keep students more accountable
* Why do you think it didn't go well?
I don't think it went well because I had too many things to check. Students were constantly creating lists and I had to check that the lists were reasonable and that they were keeping up with the lists. 
* What would you do (have you done) to make it better?
I pivoted in getting students to make goals for themselves and conferencing with them 1x a week. It was a lot faster and I found it to be more effective tool for accountability 
* Describe an instance when you were teaching somthing computer science related and it went really well.
Arrays with playing cards! I taught sorting algorithms with playing cards. I thought it was a great way to get students up and out of their seats and add a competitive edge. 
* Why do you think it went so well?
The abstraction portion was taken away by adding physical manipulatives.
