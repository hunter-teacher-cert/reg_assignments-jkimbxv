For each case study, answer the following questions:

1. Which features(s) are applied?
  * competency grading scheme
  * reminds me of a layered curriculum
  * multiple chances for success
  * mastery based grading
  * cumulative learning reinforces mastery
2. How are those features you identified applied?
  * it feels like a game where each level can be 1 to 3 stars
  * i like that you can earn different grades on different achievements
  * given the level of dedication you need in this case, perhaps this type of course would be better suited to a trimester course.
3. What do you like about this case?
  * i like that the cumulative nature reinforces the mastery based learning.
  * I also like that the portfolio prompts are something that is randomized further incentivizing close listening during class.
4. What would you want to change?
  * i love it for College and wonder if it could be implemented in a summer intensive course.
  * I'd like to learn in this environment but there are so many moving parts, I am practically panicking thinking about how I'd manage this.
5. What questions do you have about case study?
  * How did students respond to this?
