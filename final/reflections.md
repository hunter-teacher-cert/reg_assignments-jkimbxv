### Reflections on the lesson groups

My group and I were able to provide feedback to each other to further each of our lessons. I found the feedback process helpful and the scaffolding of this final deliverable helpful. Not only was it helpful for us to receive feedback from our peers but it was a good exercise for us to give feedback as well as it forced us to think about different topics in different lights and consider different student populations.

For myself, I asked for feedback along the lines of:
* best practices for code-alongs
* how to scaffold sorting algorithms

Brian is a wiz for code-alongs. He suggested having the kids try to predict what line comes next. I kind of implement that in my classroom already but I enjoyed how his felt more dynamic and engaging. My hope for the future is to have students present their own code-along segments as I find the preparation I have to do for the code-along sections is quite in depth and furthers my understanding of the code. You can't explain it unless you understand it really well.

We also talked about how best to scaffold algorithms. We harkened back to the toolbox Z mentioned over the summer where we have certain algorithms coming back over and over again. The 3 algorithms I utilized in my lesson were finding the minimum, finding the maximum, and swapping items in an array. I thought it was important that students understand these algorithms as they play a critical role in the sorting algorithms. Because of their foundational roles, I made them the homework assignments. The easy level is the swap algorithm, the medium level is the greatest to least selection sort, and the hardest is the sinking sort instead of bubble sort.

Overall, I found the exercise helpful and the time was well used. I appreciated that our final was scaffolded given we are all working folks with families.
