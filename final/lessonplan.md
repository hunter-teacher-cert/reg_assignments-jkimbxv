#Lesson Name: Intro to algorithms
###Grade: 10~12th
###Main Objectives:
* Students will be able to describe and explain two common sorting algorithms. They will also be able to implement and demonstrate these two algorithms in the python language.
###Standards:
* 9-12.CT.4: Implement a program using a combination of student-defined and third-party functions to organize the computation.
* 9-12.CT.6: Demonstrate how at least two classic algorithms work, and analyze the trade-offs related to two or more algorithms for completing the same task

##Lesson Breakdown:
###Intro: 10 minutes:
Students will sort themselves into birthday order without talking. They will be given the metacognitive task to take notes on the techniques the group is using to organize themselves. We will then regroup when the task is complete to summarize the techniques. If time allows, students will be allowed to try again in two teams to implement a more optimal solution. They will be timed.

###Main: 20 minutes
The first 10 minutes of the teacher delivered content will be an explanation of the selection sort. The explanation will be done using index cards on the board as well to show students more slowly what is shown on the gif.  There will also be a code-along of the selection sort. This involves abstraction and modulation of the find min algorithm and utilization of the python array methods such as pop() and append().

The second 10 minutes of the teacher delivered content will be an explanation of the bubble sort. The explanation will be done using index cards on the board as well to show students more slowly what is shown on the gif. There will also be a code-along of the bubble sort. This involves abstraction and modulation of the swap algorithm.

###Activity: 15 minutes
Students will be tasked with making reflections and modifications to the selection and bubble sort with choice.
* Required Reflection:
  * Which sort is better? Come up with 1 pro and 1 con of each type of sort we went over today.
  * What would happen with larger data sets? 
* Pick 1:
  * Easy: Code an algorithm that looks for the max of an array instead of the minimum
  * Medium: Code a selection sort algorithm that will sort something from greatest to least.
* Hard: Code a bubble sort algorithm that will work as the gif shows--starting from the end of the array and bubbling to the front.
