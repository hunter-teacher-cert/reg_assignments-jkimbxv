For this week's async work I completed Tiffany's data analytics lesson.

Do Now
* How many total properties did Chipotle operate? 2010
* How many Chipotle properties did Chipotle operate in the US? 2002
* How many Chipotle properties did Chipotle operate outside the US? 8
* Which geography had the most Chipotle properties? california
* Which geography had the least Chipotle properties? vermont

Activity
* analyze growth trend: looking at the overall growth trends, chipotle had a really big growth in 2012 but has dwindled a bit since then.
* analyze sales of different items: after creating a pivot table, I was able to see that the chicken bowl had the greatest quantity of sales. I suggest to increase marketing for this item. Additionally I ran a percent growth from 2014 to 2015 and saw that West Virginia had a 150% growth and it may be worth while to continue to invest in this untapped market.
