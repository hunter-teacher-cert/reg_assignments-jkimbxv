Overall, I thought this was a really engaging lesson. I don't know about your students but my students love Chipotle. I was wondering what kind of direction students would be given. I did some more "complex" things with sheets (i.e. pivot tables, percent growths, etc) that I found helpful. I think these are translatable skills students could learn to help them in a career in the future. I was wondering how this type of lesson would be scaffolded to make it easily accessible.
