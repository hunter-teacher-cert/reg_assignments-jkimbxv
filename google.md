* Create website that makes some sort of decision for you using conditionals
  - The task should involve multiple steps, ~5.

* In a markdown file:
  - Students must create a webpage that makes a decision for them based on a few criteria. The decision to be made can be unique to each student. I remember last year, a student chose a "pizza decision" to help him decide not which pizza to get but which pizza shop to go to.
* For each search you ran provide three links from the results
  - "decision maker"
    - https://www.google.com/search?q=decision+maker&rlz=1C5GCEM_en&oq=decision+maker+&aqs=chrome.0.69i59l2j0i433i512j0i512j69i60j69i61j69i65j69i60.1879j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&surl=1&safe=active&ssui=on
    - not that useful as it provided an example of a decision maker
    - i guess i could see a student trying to build an example of a decision maker.
  - "decision maker comp sci project"
    - https://www.google.com/search?q=decision+maker+comp+sci+project&rlz=1C5GCEM_en&ei=R1NCYoD8O9emptQPycmj0AE&ved=0ahUKEwjAu5TaiOr2AhVXk4kEHcnkCBoQ4dUDCA4&uact=5&oq=decision+maker+comp+sci+project&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBQghEKABMgUIIRCrAjoHCAAQRxCwAzoHCAAQsAMQQzoICAAQgAQQsQM6BQgAEIAEOgQIABBDOgYIABAWEB46BQgAEIYDOggIABAWEAoQHjoICCEQFhAdEB5KBAhBGABKBAhGGABQpQJYplxgil1oA3ABeAGAAdoBiAGYDJIBBjE2LjEuMZgBAKABAcgBCsABAQ&sclient=gws-wiz&surl=1&safe=active&ssui=on
    - this was way too helpful.
    - it didn't include copy and pasteable code but it did help a lot through the code.
    - students could learn from it.
  - "decision maker javascript"
    - this was somewhat useful
    - it gave students an overview on conditionals
    - it did include copy and pastable code but not directly related to the project

Tldr: googling a code project will get you the answers especially if you use a prescribed curriculum
